Infinite Coins

Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1
cent), write a method makeChange() to calculate and return a Set containing the ways of
representing n cents using those coins. Each element of the returned Set should represent the
number of coins to compose the entry value, an array like this: [quarters, dimes,
nickels, pennies].
The method makeChange() can use a Set data structure to store each representation of n cents,
and then, return it. A Set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements and the order of
elements is irrelevant. Consider the following interface defined for Set:
Method signature Method description
boolean add(Element e) Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present

(optional operation).

boolean addAll(Set s) Adds all elements from s that are not already present in this set.
boolean contains(Element e) Returns true if this set contains the specified element.
boolean equals(Set s) Compares the specified set s with this set for equality.
Iterator<Element> iterator() Returns an iterator over the elements in this set.
boolean remove(Element e) Removes the specified element from this set if it is present

(optional operation).

int size() Returns the number of elements in this set (its cardinality).
Element[] toArray() Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set.

Table: Set interface

Input example:
n=12
Output for the given example:
[[0,0,0,12], [0,0,1,7], [0,0,2,2], [0,1,0,2]]*
* this is the content of the Set which should be returned by the function.

Your proposed solution can be written in pseudo-code or any well-known language (C, C++, Java,
etc) and you are free to implement any auxiliary functions. Besides, write down a comment to the
implemented function, explaining how your function will work like the one below.
